# ðŸ›¡ Violence Detection and Alert System

This project is a **real-time violence detection system** that combines **computer vision (YOLOv8-Pose)**, **audio features**, and a **deep learning LSTM-Attention model** to detect potential violent activity in video streams.  
When violence is detected, the system can **trigger alerts** (e.g., send an email with snapshot evidence).
Detailed Technical report is attached above and performance metrics are attached
